-------
Phase 1 (2/2)
-------
(1) Doesn't assert protocol error when a start then start is sent
(2) Doesn't ignore inputs between done->start
-------
Phase 2 (2/2)
-------
(1) stackOverflow asserted when stack size is 8 rather than at 9, then gets
stuck at 1
(2) protocolError stuck at 0. Does not assert when pop with insufficient elems
or when stack is empty in the middle of start->done 
-------
Phase 3 (1/1)
-------
(1) Fill up stack, add them all up, the aggregated sum is wrong
-------
Phase 4 (2/2)
-------
(1) Addition is incorrect, top four bits are 1 less than the actual answer
(2) Swap decrements the stack size
-------
Phase 5 (3/3)
-------
(1) Correct is stuck at 0
(2) Only asserts protocolError for one cycle does not when pop with no elems
(3) dataOverflow stuck at 0
